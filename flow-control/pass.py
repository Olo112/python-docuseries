## --------------- Pass ---------------
# It is used as a placeholder for future implementation of functions, loops, etc.

# Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future.
# They cannot have an empty body. The interpreter would give an error. So, we use the pass statement to construct a body that does nothing.

# Examples
sequence = {'p', 'a', 's', 's'};
for val in sequence:
    pass;

def function(args):
    pass;

class Example:
    pass;
