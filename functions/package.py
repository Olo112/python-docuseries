## --------------- Packages ---------------

# What are packages?
# As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of modules, we place similar modules in one package and different modules in different packages
# Python has packages for directories and modules for files.
# A directory must contain a file named __init__.py in order for Python to consider it as a package.
# This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.
